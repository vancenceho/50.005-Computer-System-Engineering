## Programming Assignments

Additional to lab assignments, there are two programming projects in this module and due to them being projects, they are held in repositories of their own listed as followed:

1. [Programming Assignment 1: CSEShell (10%)](https://github.com/50005-computer-system-engineering/programming-assignment-1-2024-ci01-what_is_this_sem_phore)
2. [Programming Assignment 2: Secure FTP (8%)](https://github.com/50005-computer-system-engineering/programming-assignment-2-2024-ci01-what_is_this_sem_phore)

The details of the assignmnents can be found in [Programming Assignment 1](https://natalieagus.github.io/50005/pa1/intro) and [Programming Assignment 2](https://natalieagus.github.io/50005/pa2/intro).
